# Sort-your-media-files
python program to clear clutter.
We all have so many files in our file manager and there are so many types of file we need to deal with, and so many times most of us face this issue where we need to find a file in our file manager but just because of unorganized folders the job gets tedious.
So to takeover this problem and sort the different files according to their extensions like pdfs, docx, mp4, mkv, jpeg, png, so on and so forth, I made a project in python that will sort all the files according to their extensions to their respective folders.
and hence by running this program into our file manager or any other folder where we have clutter of files. We will get organized files into their respective folders.
